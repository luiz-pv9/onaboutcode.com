In my opinion, the best way to learn a new programming language or library is to build a real
project with it. It doesn't have to be too real. It also helps to isolate only the thing
you're interested in learning. It's never a good idea to learn two things at the same
time: a language and an editor, a JS lib and GraphSQL, a database and an ORM. If it
doesn't work we can never be sure about where *what* failed.
